### Call for participation

We invite participation in the workshop on "Learning and privacy with incomplete data
and weak supervision" as a part of the NIPS 2015 conference. We welcome and encourage
multidisciplinary submissions on the topic of learning individual traits from
aggregate and noisi(fied) data, and the protection against attacks of this sort.
In particular

- novel algorithms and theoretical analysis on "weakly-supervised" learning, *e.g.*
multiple instance learning, learning from label proportions, noisy labels, ecological inference
- field-specific applications in computer, biomedical and social sciences
- innovative methods and perspectives on data collection, aggregation and obfuscation
- privacy aspects of methods for data sharing and release
- application demos of the above (to run live at the workshop)
- social and legal implications and open problems

### Submission instructions

Submissions must be 4-8 pages long (+1 for references), and adhere to the [NIPS format](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2015/PaperInformation/StyleFiles).
Papers submission is here [TBA]. Please leave authors information visible.

With regard to the demos applications, we encourage the use of publicly accessible
datasets and/or code in the interest of reproducibility; this will be valued positively
for acceptance.

All accepted papers and application demos will have a short oral presentation
and a poster session. Also, selected papers will be part of a **special issue on the [Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality](http://repository.cmu.edu/jpc/)**, depending on quality and number of submissions,
 and subject to the organizers' judgement.

### Important dates

- Notification of acceptance: October 27 2015
- Notification of acceptance on the Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality: TBA
