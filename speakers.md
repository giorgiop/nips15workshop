is Assistant Professor at the University of California, San Diego. Her research
is on machine learning. Much of her work is on privacy-preserving machine learning
and unsupervised learning, but she is broadly interested in a number of topics
in learning theory, such as confidence-rated prediction, online learning, and active learning.

[Nando de Freitas](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/)

is a Computer Science Professor at Oxford University and a senior staff research scientist at [Google DeepMind](http://deepmind.com). He is also a fellow of the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR) in the Neural Computation and Adaptive Perception Program. He received his PhD from [Trinity College](http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk), Cambridge University in 2000 on Bayesian methods for neural networks. From 1999 to 2001, He was an artificial intelligence postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley.

has been working his entire career on turning bleeding edge research ideas into useful and commercially viable products and services. He recently returned to NICTA/Data61 from a company he founded previously which is using embedded ML to dramatically improve user experience around mobile video. He is now focusing on productizing confidential computing solutions to bring a healthy balance between companies' need to better understand their customers and an individual right for privacy.
